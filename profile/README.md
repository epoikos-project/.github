# EpOikoS: Self-Organization among LLM Agents

<!-- EpOikoS: Self-Organization among LLM Agents -->
Traditionally, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) for studying human social development have been built on rule-based systems and while Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for creating more realistic agents, existing implementations often lack reusability and comparability. 

To address this gap, we introduce **EpOikoS**, a modular and generalized LLM-based simulation framework with an architecture designed for reuse- and extensibility. We propose three key innovations: (1) conditional agents that reduce computational costs and stabilize action calling, (2) a continuous event logging system that enables simulation replay and analysis, and (3) a "Reason-Act-Plan" prompting strategy that structures agent decision-making for more consistent and interpretable behavior.
We demonstrate the framework's capabilities and scalability by replicating the EOS project, a study of Paleolithic human behavior, which used traditional ABMs. We introduce a novel evaluation strategy that assesses simulation success at two distinct levels: a local level, focusing on the behavior of a single agent in a unit test fashion, and a global level, analyzing emergent outcomes from long-running simulations using a relationship graph. Our results establish EpOikoS as a robust platform for conducting verifiable and comparable large-scale social simulations. In addition, our dual-level evaluation strategy provides a comprehensive method for measuring their success.
